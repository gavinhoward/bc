> Mr. Brown,
>
> The website is, unfortunately, now defunct. [GitHub](https://github.com/gavinhoward/bc) is now the place to submit them. I just couldn't deal with the scraping.
>
> Just so you know, my bc is less than 8 years old, so the bug cannot be 27 years old. The bc version 1.05 from 1998 is actually the GNU bc, not mine.
>
> As you can see, the bug is in multiple bc implementations, and there is a reason.
>
> The bug is due to the way the spec is worded, as you noticed in your bug report. It would be fairly easy to fix for hexadecimal, but the other bases would be harder. But nevertheless, the spec defines what bc should do. This includes using decimal arithmetic on the inside; I cannot change that without violating the spec. The relevant portion says, "Internal computations shall be conducted as if in decimal, regardless of the input and output bases, to the specified number of decimal digits. When an exact result is not achieved (for example, scale=0; 3.2/1), the result shall be truncated."
>
> There may be a way to fix it without violating the spec, but unfortunately, [I can no longer afford to do more work on bc without pay](https://github.com/gavinhoward/bc/commit/341c9388).
>
> The easiest way, I think, would be to use integers, but to have a bc function that will print out those integers as though they were floating point numbers.

> No… I allocated enough extra scale digits to hold all the bits of information I typed.
>
> Deletion of customer data is unethical. Excuses made by the spec are not of interest to me.

> I'll show myself out. Good day, and good-bye.

> Mr. Brown:
>
> You are absolutely right. Loss of customer data is unethical. To that end, I have refunded you the amount you paid me for the use of bc.
>
> Joking aside, please remember that I am doing this in my free time and that I don't have customers. The license says that bc comes "as-is."
